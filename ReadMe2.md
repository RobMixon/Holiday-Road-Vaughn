# Project Title

Holiday Road - Team Vaughn (Rob Mixon, Brendan Abernethy, Tasha Lane, & Jonathan Riley)

# Description

We were tasked with building an application that will allow people to build itineraries for their trips to National Parks utilizing data fetched from the National Park service API, weather data fetched from Open Weather API, along with eateries and attraction destinations fetched from local source APIs. We utilized HTML, CSS, and JavaScript to build our website. We utilized open-source APIs to fetch our real-time data. Users can click on a park option and have current weather details populate. They can also select an attraction and eatery to visit and see basic details concerning both.
